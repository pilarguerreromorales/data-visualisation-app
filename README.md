# InsightGRAPHIX – Data Visualisation App

## Project Overview
InsightGRAPHIX is a Python-based application that provides interactive visualisations of demographic, human capital, and world population data.  
The tool allows users to explore regions and countries through graphical menus and generates plots such as:

- Population age distribution (pie chart)  
- Education enrollment rates (stacked bar chart)  
- Life expectancy by gender (stacked bar chart)  
- Total population by region (bar chart)  
- Population growth over time (line chart)  

This project was developed as part of a business and data analysis challenge to support market expansion strategies by providing comparative insights between regions and countries.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pilarguerreromorales/data-visualisation-app.git
   cd data-visualisation-app
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended)**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   # macOS/Linux
   source venv/bin/activate
   # Windows (PowerShell)
   venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   # Windows (CMD)
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Run the main program with:

```bash
python main.py
```

## macOS users – Tkinter issue

This app uses `graphics.py`, which depends on **Tkinter**.  
If you see an error like:

```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named '_tkinter'
```

your Python installation doesn’t include Tk.

### Fix options:

**Option A – Homebrew Python 3.12 with Tk:**
```bash
brew install python@3.12 python-tk@3.12
rm -rf venv
"$(brew --prefix python@3.12)"/bin/python3.12 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Option B – python.org installer (recommended for macOS):**
- Download and install Python 3.12 (or 3.11) from [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/).  
- Recreate the virtual environment with that interpreter:
  ```bash
  rm -rf venv
  /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.12/bin/python3 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

Check Tkinter is available:
```bash
python -c "import tkinter as tk; print('Tk OK, version', tk.TkVersion)"
```


This will open a graphical interface window where you can:

- Click **START** to begin  
- Select either **Regional plots** or **Country-specific population growth**  
- Navigate through menus to generate visualisations of your choice  
- Go back to the main menu or quit at any time

## Example Visualisations

Here are examples of different charts generated by the app:

### Population Distribution (Pie Chart)
![Population Distribution by Age Group](Screenshot-pie.png)

### Life Expectancy by Regions (Stacked Bar Chart)
![Life Expectancy by Regions](Screenshot-stackedbar.png)

### Population Growth Over Time (Line Chart)
![Population Over Time - Argentina](Screenshot-line.png)

## Requirements

The project depends on the following key Python packages:

- `pandas`  
- `matplotlib`  
- `openpyxl`  
- `graphics.py`

The full dependency list is included in `requirements.txt`.
